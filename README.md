# Basic Web Development Course 👨🏽‍💻

This course is oriented for beginning students where before writing code, we will learn how the internet works. We will understand topics such as protocols, the difference between the web and the internet, the history of the web and how it has evolved to become what it is today.

We will learn how a browser works, the tool we use to navigate the internet (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) We will learn to configure our work environment including the use of Visual Studio Code. With our environment ready, it's time to start with the bases. We will see in detail the two web standards that the browser understands when creating web products: HTML and CSS.

A project will be carried out for the entire course which will be created entirely in HTML and CSS, basic and advanced techniques will also be learned to structure any project.
